WIP: This project controls four linear motors in order to appropriately steer and bend a bendable needle.

## Getting Started
<!---

This section should contain installation, testing, and running instructions for people who want to get started with the project. 

- These instructions should work on a clean system.
- These instructions should work without having to install an IDE.
- You can specify that the user should have a certain operating system.

--->
Clone or download the project to your local machine.

This Program runs in Python 3. We are certain the program supports Python 3.8.5, use an older Python 3 version at own risk. Python2 will not run.
